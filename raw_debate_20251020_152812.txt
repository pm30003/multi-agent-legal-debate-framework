PLAINTIFF ROUND 1 :
----------------------------------------
The issue at hand is whether the employees are entitled to full salary payment and compensation when the employer withholds wages due to pandemic-related financial difficulties. The Payment of Wages Act, 1936, is the governing legislation for this case.

The Payment of Wages Act, 1936, specifically Section 3, states that the wages of every employee shall be paid in current coin or currency notes or both, on or before the seventh day of the month next following the month for which the wages are payable. Section 5 of the Act provides that if an employer fails to pay the wages of an employee on or before the due date, the employee shall be entitled to a compensation.

The company's claim of force majeure due to lockdown restrictions and supply chain disruptions does not absolve them of their liability to pay wages to their employees. The concept of force majeure is not explicitly defined in the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, but it can be interpreted to mean an event that is beyond the control of the parties and could not be reasonably anticipated.

However, in this case, the company's financial difficulties due to the pandemic do not justify the withholding of wages. The Supreme Court of India in the case of Workers of Subhash Maize Products and Ors. v. Subhash Maize Products and Anr. (2005) 2 SCC 363, held that the non-payment of wages to workers during the closure of a factory due to financial difficulties does not entitle the employer to withhold wages.

The employees are entitled to full salary payment and compensation under Section 5 of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936. The company is liable to pay the withheld wages along with compensation, which is equivalent to the amount of wages that were not paid on time.

Furthermore, the Right to Work is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, as held in the case of Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation and Ors. (1985) 3 SCC 249. The non-payment of wages to employees during the pandemic would amount to a violation of their right to work and a denial of their livelihood.

The company's actions in withholding wages are also in violation of the principles of social justice and the directive principles of state policy under Part IV of the Constitution of India. The Supreme Court in the case of Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru and Ors. v. State of Kerala and Anr. (1973) 4 SCC 225, held that the directive principles of state policy are fundamental to the governance of the country and it is the duty of the state to promote social and economic justice.

In conclusion, the employees are entitled to full salary payment and compensation under the Payment of Wages Act, 1936. The company's claim of force majeure is not a valid defense, and the withholding of wages amounts to a violation of the employees' fundamental rights and the principles of social justice.

The employees are entitled to the following remedies:

* Full salary payment for the four months
* Compensation under Section 5 of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936
* Interest on the withheld wages
* Costs and expenses incurred in filing and pursuing the complaint

The company should be directed to pay the withheld wages and compensation to the employees within a specified timeframe. Failure to comply with the order should result in further action, including penalties and prosecution under the Payment of Wages Act, 1936.

PLAINTIFF ROUND 2 :
----------------------------------------
The defendant's argument hinges on the claim that the COVID-19 pandemic and its resultant lockdown restrictions and supply chain disruptions constituted a force majeure event that absolved them of their responsibility to pay wages to their employees. While it is true that the pandemic presented unprecedented challenges to businesses worldwide, it is essential to examine whether these challenges legally justify the withholding of wages.

The Payment of Wages Act, 1936, is a legislation aimed at protecting the rights of employees to receive their wages in a timely manner. Section 3 of the Act stipulates that wages shall be paid to an employee without deductions, except those authorized by law. The Act does not provide for an exemption from this obligation based on financial difficulties, let alone those caused by a force majeure event. 

The defendant's reliance on the concept of force majeure as a justification for not paying wages is misplaced. While force majeure can be a valid defense in certain contractual disputes, its application in the context of employment law, specifically the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, is limited. The Act places the risk of business disruptions on the employer, not the employees. It is the employer's responsibility to manage their finances and operations in a way that ensures compliance with statutory obligations, including the payment of wages.

Furthermore, the defendant's argument that it is unfair to expect the company to bear the entire burden of the pandemic's impact is not persuasive. The impact of the pandemic was indeed widespread, but the law provides mechanisms for employers to negotiate with employees or seek government assistance in extraordinary circumstances. However, withholding wages is not a permissible response under the law.

The Supreme Court of India has recognized the importance of protecting employees' rights in various judgments. In the case of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan and Anr. v. S.C. Sharma, the Court held that the right to receive wages is a fundamental right. Although this case did not directly deal with the issue of force majeure, it underscores the judiciary's stance on prioritizing employees' rights.

In contrast, the defendant's argument does not adequately account for the vulnerabilities of employees who depend on their wages for their livelihood. The lockdown and supply chain disruptions may have affected the company's operations, but they also had a disproportionate impact on employees who were suddenly deprived of their income.

The defendant's claim that the lockdown restrictions and supply chain disruptions were beyond their control is a fact that does not negate their statutory obligation to pay wages. What is required is not for the company to claim impossibility but to demonstrate that they have taken all reasonable steps to mitigate the impact on employees, which includes communicating with them, providing support where possible, and adhering to legal requirements.

In conclusion, while the COVID-19 pandemic presented significant challenges, it does not exempt employers from their statutory obligations under the Payment of Wages Act, 1936. The employees are entitled to their full salary payment and compensation for the delay. The law prioritizes the protection of employees' rights, and it is the employer's responsibility to manage their operations within the bounds of these rights.

PLAINTIFF ROUND 3 :
----------------------------------------
The defendant's argument hinges on the claim that the COVID-19 pandemic and its resultant lockdown restrictions and supply chain disruptions constituted a force majeure event that absolved them of their responsibility to pay wages to their employees. However, this argument is not entirely convincing. While it is true that the pandemic presented unprecedented challenges to businesses worldwide, it does not necessarily follow that employers are exempt from their statutory obligations to pay wages.

The Payment of Wages Act, 1936, is clear in its provisions regarding the timely payment of wages. Section 4 of the Act states that wages shall be paid to the employee on the last day of the month or on the day specified in the agreement or service conditions. The Act does not provide for an exception to this rule based on financial difficulties, let alone those caused by a pandemic. The defendant's reliance on force majeure as a justification for withholding wages is misplaced, as it is not a valid defense under the Act.

Furthermore, the defendant's argument that the pandemic had a devastating impact on their operations and resulted in significant financial losses is not supported by evidence. While it is likely that many businesses, including ABC Manufacturing Company, faced challenges during the pandemic, it is not clear that these challenges justified the withholding of wages from employees. In fact, the defendant's decision to withhold wages for four months raises questions about their financial management and prioritization of expenses.

In contrast, the plaintiff's position is supported by the principles of social justice and the protective intent of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936. The Act is designed to ensure that employees receive their wages in a timely manner, and its provisions are intended to safeguard employees from exploitation. In the case of ABC Manufacturing Company, the withholding of wages for four months had a significant impact on the employees, who were left without a source of income during a difficult period.

The defendant's argument also overlooks the fact that many employers found ways to adapt to the pandemic and continue to pay their employees, albeit through innovative means such as work-from-home arrangements or temporary reductions in hours. The fact that ABC Manufacturing Company chose not to explore these options and instead withheld wages from their employees raises questions about their commitment to their workforce.

In terms of additional evidence, we would like to cite the judgment in the case of Workmen of Firestone Synthetic Rubber Limited v. Firestone Synthetic Rubber Limited (1981) I LLJ 409, where the Supreme Court held that an employer's financial difficulties do not justify the withholding of wages from employees. The Court emphasized that the payment of wages is a statutory obligation that cannot be avoided by invoking financial constraints.

In conclusion, the defendant's argument that the COVID-19 pandemic and its resultant lockdown restrictions and supply chain disruptions justified the withholding of wages from employees is not convincing. The Payment of Wages Act, 1936, is clear in its provisions regarding the timely payment of wages, and the defendant's reliance on force majeure as a justification for withholding wages is misplaced. We urge the court to consider the principles of social justice and the protective intent of the Act, and to rule in favor of the plaintiff.

PLAINTIFF ROUND 4 :
----------------------------------------
The defendant's argument continues to rely on the claim that the COVID-19 pandemic constituted a force majeure event that justified the withholding of wages. However, this argument is not entirely convincing, as it fails to consider the legal obligations of employers under the Payment of Wages Act, 1936. While it is true that the pandemic presented extraordinary challenges to businesses worldwide, it is equally true that employers have a statutory obligation to pay their employees' wages in a timely manner.

The defendant's assertion that the lockdown restrictions and supply chain disruptions were beyond their control is not disputed. However, this does not necessarily absolve them of their responsibility to pay their employees' wages. In fact, the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, specifically provides for situations where employers may be exempt from paying wages, but such exemptions are narrowly defined and do not include financial difficulties caused by unforeseen events.

Furthermore, the defendant's argument that it is unreasonable to expect them to have anticipated and prepared for the pandemic's impact on their business is not supported by the law. Employers have a duty to ensure that they are able to meet their statutory obligations, including paying their employees' wages, regardless of the challenges they may face.

In contrast, the plaintiff's position is supported by the principles established in the Vishaka case, which recognized that employers have a responsibility to ensure that their employees' fundamental rights are respected. The withholding of wages for an extended period of four months has a significant impact on the employees' livelihoods and well-being, and it is not reasonable to expect them to bear the brunt of the company's financial difficulties.

The Kesavananda Bharati case, cited by the defendant, is not directly relevant to this matter, as it deals with the extent of Parliament's power to amend the Constitution. However, the case does establish the importance of upholding the rule of law and respecting the rights of individuals, which is directly applicable to this case.

In terms of remedies available under the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, the employees are entitled to full salary payment and compensation for the delay in payment. Section 5 of the Act provides for punishment for non-payment of wages, which includes a fine and imprisonment. Additionally, the Act provides for the employees to file a complaint with the authorities, who can then direct the employer to pay the wages owed.

In conclusion, the defendant's argument that the COVID-19 pandemic constituted a force majeure event that justified the withholding of wages is not convincing. The plaintiff's position is supported by the principles established in relevant case law and the provisions of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936. The employees are entitled to full salary payment and compensation for the delay in payment, and the defendant's failure to meet their statutory obligations renders them liable for punishment and other remedies under the Act.

DEFENDANT ROUND 1 :
----------------------------------------
The defendant, ABC Manufacturing Company, strongly disputes the claims made by the employees under the Payment of Wages Act, 1936. The company's decision to withhold salaries for a period of four months was necessitated by the unprecedented circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a devastating impact on the company's financial situation. The lockdown restrictions and supply chain disruptions were beyond the company's control, and it is unfair to expect the company to bear the entire burden of the pandemic.

The company relies on the doctrine of force majeure, which is a well-established principle in contract law that excuses a party from performing its obligations under a contract when circumstances beyond its control prevent it from doing so. In this case, the pandemic and the resulting lockdown restrictions and supply chain disruptions constitute a force majeure event that prevented the company from paying its employees' salaries on time. The company had taken all reasonable steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, but it was unable to avoid the financial difficulties that arose as a result.

The employees' claim under the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, is therefore misconceived. The Act is intended to protect employees from exploitation by employers, but it does not provide for situations where the employer is genuinely unable to pay its employees due to circumstances beyond its control. The company is not trying to avoid its obligations to its employees, but it is seeking a reasonable and fair solution to the difficulties that it faced during the pandemic. The employees' demand for full salary payment and compensation is unreasonable and unsustainable in law.

The company also distinguishes its case from the Vishaka case, which is often cited as a precedent for recognizing the rights of employees. However, the Vishaka case dealt with the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace, which is a completely different issue from the one at hand. The company is not disputing the employees' rights under the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, but it is seeking to apply the doctrine of force majeure to excuse its non-payment of salaries during the pandemic. The Kesavananda Bharati case, on the other hand, dealt with the issue of parliamentary supremacy and the limits of judicial review, which is not relevant to the present case.

In terms of procedural defenses, the company argues that the employees' complaint is barred by the doctrine of laches, which prevents a party from asserting its rights after an unreasonable delay. The employees waited for several months before filing their complaint, which is an unreasonable delay in the circumstances. The company also argues that the employees have not followed the proper procedure for filing a complaint under the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, and that their complaint is therefore liable to be dismissed on technical grounds.

In conclusion, the defendant company strongly disputes the claims made by the employees under the Payment of Wages Act, 1936. The company's decision to withhold salaries was necessitated by the unprecedented circumstances of the pandemic, and it is seeking to apply the doctrine of force majeure to excuse its non-payment of salaries during that period. The employees' demand for full salary payment and compensation is unreasonable and unsustainable in law, and the company is confident that it will be able to defend its position in court.

DEFENDANT ROUND 2 :
----------------------------------------
The plaintiff's latest argument relies heavily on the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, and its provisions regarding the timely payment of wages. However, they conveniently overlook the extraordinary circumstances that led to the withholding of salaries by ABC Manufacturing Company. The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown restrictions imposed by the government had a devastating impact on the company's operations, resulting in significant financial losses. It is essential to consider the doctrine of force majeure, which recognizes that unforeseen events can prevent parties from fulfilling their contractual obligations.

The plaintiff's rigid interpretation of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, fails to account for the unprecedented challenges faced by the company during the pandemic. Section 3 of the Act, which mandates the payment of wages on or before the seventh day of the month next following the month for which the wages are payable, does not provide for exceptions in cases of force majeure. However, this does not mean that the company's decision to withhold salaries was unjustified. The company's actions were necessary to ensure its survival and prevent more severe consequences, such as mass layoffs or even bankruptcy.

Furthermore, the plaintiff's argument ignores the fact that the company has not entirely withheld salaries but has only delayed payment due to circumstances beyond its control. This distinction is crucial, as it highlights the company's commitment to paying its employees once its financial situation improves. The plaintiff's demand for full salary payment and compensation is unreasonable, given the extraordinary circumstances that led to the delay. The company is willing to negotiate a reasonable settlement with its employees, taking into account the financial constraints it faced during the pandemic.

The plaintiff's reliance on the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, is also problematic, as it overlooks other relevant laws and regulations that may apply to this case. For instance, the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, provides a framework for resolving disputes between employers and employees, including those related to wage payments. The company's decision to withhold salaries may be subject to the provisions of this Act, which could provide a more nuanced approach to resolving the dispute. The plaintiff's failure to consider these alternative legal frameworks weakens their argument and demonstrates a lack of understanding of the complex legal issues involved.

In conclusion, the plaintiff's argument is based on a narrow and inflexible interpretation of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, which fails to account for the extraordinary circumstances faced by ABC Manufacturing Company during the pandemic. The company's decision to withhold salaries was a necessary response to the unprecedented challenges it faced, and the plaintiff's demand for full salary payment and compensation is unreasonable. The company is committed to finding a reasonable solution that takes into account the financial constraints it faced during the pandemic, and it is willing to negotiate a settlement with its employees. The law supports the company's position, and the plaintiff's argument is flawed due to its failure to consider the doctrine of force majeure, alternative legal frameworks, and the company's commitment to paying its employees once its financial situation improves.

DEFENDANT ROUND 3 :
----------------------------------------
The plaintiff's latest argument attempts to downplay the significance of the COVID-19 pandemic as a force majeure event that justified the withholding of wages by my client, ABC Manufacturing Company. However, it is crucial to recognize that the pandemic was an unforeseen and unprecedented event that brought about extraordinary challenges to businesses worldwide. The lockdown restrictions and supply chain disruptions that ensued were beyond the control of my client, and it is unreasonable to expect them to have anticipated and prepared for such an event.

The plaintiff relies heavily on the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, but fails to consider the provisions of the Act that allow for exceptions in cases of unforeseen circumstances. The Act does not provide for a blanket obligation on the part of the employer to pay wages under all circumstances. In fact, the Act recognizes that there may be situations where the payment of wages may not be feasible, and it is in such situations that the concept of force majeure becomes relevant. My client's decision to withhold wages was not a voluntary one, but rather a necessary response to the extraordinary circumstances presented by the pandemic.

The plaintiff's argument also overlooks the fact that my client has not entirely withheld wages, but rather delayed payment due to circumstances beyond their control. The company has not abandoned its responsibility to pay its employees, but rather has been forced to temporarily suspend payments due to the financial constraints imposed by the pandemic. This is a critical distinction that the plaintiff fails to acknowledge. Furthermore, my client has taken all reasonable steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on its business and has made efforts to resume payments as soon as possible.

In terms of precedents, the plaintiff's argument is distinguishable from the cases cited in the Vishaka judgment and the Kesavananda Bharati case, which dealt with entirely different factual scenarios. Those cases do not provide a relevant analogy to the present situation, where the employer is facing unprecedented challenges due to a global pandemic. In contrast, my client's situation is more akin to cases where courts have recognized the doctrine of force majeure as a valid defense in contractual disputes.

The law supports my client's position, as the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, is not intended to impose an absolute obligation on employers to pay wages under all circumstances. The Act must be interpreted in a manner that takes into account the realities of the business world and the unforeseen challenges that may arise. In this case, the COVID-19 pandemic presented a legitimate force majeure event that justified the temporary withholding of wages. My client's actions were reasonable and necessary in the circumstances, and the law should recognize this reality. Ultimately, the plaintiff's argument is based on an overly simplistic reading of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, and fails to account for the complexities and nuances of the present case.

DEFENDANT ROUND 4 :
----------------------------------------
The plaintiff's latest argument attempts to undermine the defendant's position by suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic and its resultant lockdown restrictions and supply chain disruptions do not entirely absolve the employer of their responsibility to pay wages. However, this argument overlooks the fundamental principle of force majeure, which recognizes that certain events are beyond the control of parties and may excuse them from performing their contractual obligations. In the present case, the COVID-19 pandemic and its attendant lockdown restrictions and supply chain disruptions clearly constitute a force majeure event that prevented the defendant from paying wages to its employees.

The plaintiff's argument that the pandemic does not necessarily exempt employers from their statutory obligations to pay wages is not supported by the relevant legal framework. The Payment of Wages Act, 1936, does not provide for a situation where an employer is prevented from paying wages due to circumstances beyond their control. In such cases, the doctrine of force majeure applies, and the employer cannot be held liable for non-payment of wages. The defendant's decision to withhold salaries for a period of four months was a reasonable response to the extraordinary circumstances presented by the pandemic, and it does not constitute a violation of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936.

Furthermore, the plaintiff's argument ignores the fact that the defendant took all reasonable steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on its business and employees. The company explored alternative arrangements, such as reduced working hours and temporary layoffs, to minimize the financial burden on its employees. However, these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful due to the unprecedented nature of the pandemic and its widespread impact on the economy. The defendant's actions demonstrate a genuine attempt to balance its business interests with its obligations to its employees, and it should not be penalized for circumstances beyond its control.

The plaintiff's reliance on the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, is also misplaced. While the Act does provide for the timely payment of wages, it does not account for situations where an employer is prevented from paying wages due to force majeure events. The defendant's position is supported by the judgment in the Kesavananda Bharati case, which recognized the importance of considering the broader context and circumstances surrounding a case. In the present case, the COVID-19 pandemic and its attendant lockdown restrictions and supply chain disruptions constitute a unique and unprecedented set of circumstances that justify the defendant's decision to withhold wages.

In conclusion, the plaintiff's argument that the defendant's decision to withhold wages was not justified by the COVID-19 pandemic is not supported by the relevant legal framework or the facts of the case. The defendant's position is supported by the doctrine of force majeure, which recognizes that certain events are beyond the control of parties and may excuse them from performing their contractual obligations. The Payment of Wages Act, 1936, does not provide for situations where an employer is prevented from paying wages due to circumstances beyond their control, and the defendant's actions demonstrate a genuine attempt to balance its business interests with its obligations to its employees. Therefore, the defendant's decision to withhold wages for a period of four months was reasonable and justified, and it does not constitute a violation of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936.

JUDICIAL DECISION 
================================================================================

After carefully reviewing the complete debate record, I have analyzed the legal merits of each party's position and evaluated the evolution of their arguments across all four rounds. The plaintiff's position, which is based on the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, and the defendant's obligation to pay wages in a timely manner, has remained consistent throughout the debate. The defendant, on the other hand, has relied on the doctrine of force majeure to justify the withholding of wages, citing the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Upon examination of the arguments presented, it is clear that the plaintiff has presented a stronger case. The Payment of Wages Act, 1936, is a legislation aimed at protecting the rights of employees to receive their wages in a timely manner, and its provisions are clear and unambiguous. The Act does not provide for an exception to the rule of timely payment of wages based on financial difficulties, let alone those caused by a pandemic. The plaintiff's argument that the defendant's reliance on force majeure is misplaced is well-founded, as the concept of force majeure is not a valid defense under the Payment of Wages Act, 1936.

The defendant's argument, while acknowledging the challenges posed by the pandemic, fails to account for the statutory obligations of employers under the Payment of Wages Act, 1936. The defendant's claim that the pandemic and its resultant lockdown restrictions and supply chain disruptions constituted a force majeure event that justified the withholding of wages is not supported by the relevant legal framework. The Payment of Wages Act, 1936, places the risk of business disruptions on the employer, not the employees, and it is the employer's responsibility to manage their finances and operations in a way that ensures compliance with statutory obligations, including the payment of wages.

The consensus metrics, which indicate a final consensus score of 0.364, suggest that the debate has not reached a clear consensus. However, this does not detract from the strength of the plaintiff's argument, which is based on a clear and nuanced understanding of the relevant legal principles. The quality of legal reasoning presented by the plaintiff is superior, as it takes into account the protective intent of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, and the principles of social justice that underlie it.

In reaching my decision, I have applied the relevant legal principles, including the provisions of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, and the concept of force majeure. I have also considered the judgments of the Supreme Court of India, including the Vishaka case and the Kesavananda Bharati case, which emphasize the importance of protecting employees' rights and upholding the rule of law. Based on these principles, I find that the defendant's decision to withhold wages from its employees for a period of four months was unjustified and constitutes a violation of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936.

Therefore, I hereby render my judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant, ABC Manufacturing Company, is directed to pay the withheld wages to its employees, along with compensation for the delay in payment, as provided under Section 5 of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936. The defendant is also liable for punishment, including a fine and imprisonment, as provided under the Act. This judgment is based on the clear and unambiguous provisions of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, and the principles of social justice and the protective intent of the Act. The defendant's failure to meet its statutory obligations renders it liable for the consequences, and this judgment is a necessary step to uphold the rights of the employees and ensure that justice is served.
