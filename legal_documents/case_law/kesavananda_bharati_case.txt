Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru and Ors. v. State of Kerala and Anr.
AIR 1973 SC 1461, (1973) 4 SCC 225

SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Civil Appeal Nos. 135-136 of 1970
Decided on: April 24, 1973

JUDGMENT:
BY THE COURT:

This case involves the fundamental question of the extent of Parliament's power to amend the Constitution under Article 368. The petitioner challenged the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1969, which was placed in the Ninth Schedule by the Constitution (Twenty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1972.

BASIC STRUCTURE DOCTRINE:
The Court held by a majority that while Parliament has wide powers to amend the Constitution, it cannot alter the "basic structure" or "essential features" of the Constitution. The basic structure includes:

1. Supremacy of the Constitution
2. Republican and Democratic form of government
3. Secular character of the Constitution
4. Separation of powers between the legislature, executive and judiciary
5. Federal character of the Constitution
6. Unity and integrity of the nation
7. Welfare state (socio-economic justice)
8. Judicial review
9. Rule of law
10. Individual freedom and dignity
11. Parliamentary system
12. Independence of the judiciary

MAJORITY JUDGMENT:
Sikri, C.J. (for the majority):
"The Constitution is a precious heritage; therefore, you cannot destroy its identity. While Parliament has constituent power, it cannot use this power to destroy the basic elements or fundamental features of the Constitution."

"The word 'amendment' postulates that the old Constitution survives without loss of its identity despite the change and continues even though it has been subjected to alterations."

IMPACT AND SIGNIFICANCE:
1. This judgment established the basic structure doctrine as a cornerstone of Indian constitutional law
2. It limited Parliament's amending power while preserving constitutional democracy
3. It strengthened judicial review and the independence of the judiciary
4. It protected fundamental rights from being completely abolished
5. It ensured the Constitution's democratic and secular character remains intact

The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution remains a living document that can adapt to changing circumstances while preserving its fundamental character and the values it embodies.
