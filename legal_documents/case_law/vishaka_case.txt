Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan
AIR 1997 SC 3011, (1997) 6 SCC 241

SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 666-70 of 1992
Decided on: August 13, 1997

JUDGMENT:
Verma, CJ.:

This case establishes the fundamental right of women to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. The guidelines laid down herein are known as the Vishaka Guidelines.

FACTS:
Bhanwari Devi, a social worker in Rajasthan, was gang-raped as an act of social vengeance when she tried to prevent a child marriage in her village. The incident highlighted the vulnerability of working women and the absence of specific laws dealing with sexual harassment at workplace.

FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO WORK WITH DIGNITY:
The Court held that the right to work with dignity is a fundamental right of women under Articles 14, 15, 19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution:
"Sexual harassment of women at workplace is incompatible with the dignity and honour of women and needs to be eliminated. It is a violation of the rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution."

VISHAKA GUIDELINES:
The Court laid down comprehensive guidelines for prevention of sexual harassment:

1. Definition of Sexual Harassment:
   - Unwelcome sexually determined behaviour (whether directly or by implication)
   - Physical contact and advances
   - Demand or request for sexual favours
   - Sexually coloured remarks
   - Showing pornography
   - Any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature

2. Preventive Steps:
   - Express prohibition of sexual harassment
   - Awareness programs
   - Display of guidelines prominently
   - Appropriate penalties in service rules

3. Complaints Committee:
   - Complaints committee headed by a woman
   - Half of the members should be women
   - Third party participation to prevent undue pressure
   - Confidential treatment of complaints

4. Complaint Mechanism:

   - Written complaint with details
   - Inquiry to be completed within reasonable time
   - Natural justice principles to be followed

5. Punishment:

   - Penalty proportionate to misconduct
   - Compensation to victim in appropriate cases

IMPACT:
This judgment:
1. Recognized sexual harassment as violation of fundamental rights

3. Made workplace sexual harassment legally cognizable
4. Led to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013
