Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India
AIR 1978 SC 597, (1978) 1 SCC 248

SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Writ Petition (Civil) No. 27 of 1978
Decided on: January 25, 1978

JUDGMENT:
Bhagwati, J.:

This case marks a revolutionary expansion in the interpretation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India and establishes the interconnectedness of fundamental rights.

FACTS:
Maneka Gandhi, a journalist and social activist, had her passport impounded by the Regional Passport Officer, New Delhi, under Section 10(3)(c) of the Passports Act, 1967, on the ground that it was "in the interest of the general public" that the passport should be impounded. No reasons were provided to her for this action, nor was she given an opportunity to be heard before the impoundment.

REVOLUTIONARY INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE 21:
The Court held that Article 21 is not merely a procedural safeguard but embodies substantive rights. The "procedure established by law" must be:
- Just, fair and reasonable
- Not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive
- In accordance with principles of natural justice

Justice Bhagwati observed:
"The procedure cannot be arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable. The procedure must be 'right and just and fair' and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive; otherwise, it would be no procedure at all and the requirement of Article 21 would not be satisfied."

RIGHT TO TRAVEL ABROAD:
The Court recognized that the right to travel abroad is part of personal liberty under Article 21:
"Personal liberty in Article 21 is of the widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to constitute the personal liberty of man and some of them have been raised to the status of distinct fundamental rights and given additional protection under Article 19."

INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS:
The Court established that fundamental rights are not mutually exclusive but form an integrated scheme:
"Articles 14, 19 and 21 are not mutually exclusive. They sustain, strengthen and nourish each other. Article 21 derives its life and substance from Articles 14 and 19."

GOLDEN TRIANGLE DOCTRINE:
The judgment established the "Golden Triangle" of Articles 14, 19, and 21:
- Article 14 (Equality): Any law that is arbitrary would violate Article 14
- Article 19 (Freedom): Restrictions must be reasonable and in public interest  
- Article 21 (Life and Liberty): Procedure must be just, fair and reasonable

This case continues to be cited as the cornerstone for expanding fundamental rights and ensuring that state power is exercised in accordance with constitutional values of justice, fairness, and reasonableness.
